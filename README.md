# Eyewriter

A DIY, open-source remote eye tracking toolkit meant to enable artistic digital expression for artists and students with diverse needs. 

This repo contains all of the source files necessary to fabricate and program the electronics system, as well as fabricate an adjustable 3D-printable platform that can be clamped onto any laptop or set on a table.

#### This repo contains:
* 3D files = all of the OpenSCAD scripts (and rendered STLs) for all of the 3D-printable files.
* Arduino sketches = sketches that can be loaded onto the electronics platform.
* BOMs = bills of materials for all required parts for the project.
* Eagle files = design files for all of the electronics modules
* oF app = openFrameworks program to translate camera data into usable actions
